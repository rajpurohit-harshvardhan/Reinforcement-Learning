# Reinforcement-Learning
A reinforcement learning project for picking up a card from a deck, based on SARSA

The main file that implements the algorithm for the card picking game are:
custom_environment :: sets the whole environment using GYM library
SARSA_main :: main file to be executed for the implementation of algorithm
